### RSI Heatmap Integration

The RSI Heatmap feature is integrated into the Tools section of the portfolio. It leverages a Flask backend to generate real-time heatmaps of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for top cryptocurrencies. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the integration process:

1. **Backend Deployment**:
    - The RSI heatmap backend was deployed using Flask and is hosted on [Railway](https://railway.app).
    - The backend generates the RSI heatmap image, which the Svelte frontend fetches and displays.

2. **Frontend Integration**:
    - In the `tools.svelte` file, a fetch request is made to the deployed backend to retrieve the heatmap image. The image is then dynamically displayed in the Svelte application.

3. **CORS Configuration**:
    - To allow the frontend to request resources from the backend hosted on a different domain, we enabled Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in the Flask backend.

4. **Modifications**:
    - The original RSI heatmap code was adapted to fit our specific deployment needs, including path adjustments for image saving and CORS handling.

Steps to Restart the Project After Reboot

    Open Terminal and navigate to your project directory:

   

cd ~/Desktop/My_portfolio

Start Docker:

    Make sure Docker Desktop is running. If it's not, start Docker Desktop from your applications.

Build the Docker image (if needed):

    If you haven't built the Docker image yet or if there have been changes, build the image:



docker build -t my_svelte_app .

Run the Docker container:



    docker run -p 8081:4173 -p 5002:5001 my_svelte_app

    Ensure there are no port conflicts. If there are, stop the conflicting services or containers and try running the command again.

    Access the application:
        For the Svelte application: http://localhost:5173
        For the API (heatmap): http://localhost:5002/heatmap

Troubleshooting Tips

    Check Docker Status:
        Make sure Docker is running. If you encounter issues, restart Docker Desktop.

    Check Logs:
        If the application is not running as expected, check the Docker container logs:

  

    docker logs <container_id>

    Port Conflicts:
        Ensure no other services are running on ports 8081 or 5002. Use lsof -i :<port> to check and kill -9 <PID> to stop them if necessary.
